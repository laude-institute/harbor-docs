import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

The Harbor registry allows you to share your datasets with the community. Once registered, anyone can run your dataset using the `harbor run -d "your-dataset@version"` command.

<Callout title="CLI Coming Soon">
We have CLI commands coming soon that will drastically simplify the process of hosting and registering datasets. Stay tuned!

## Registration Steps

### 1. Push your tasks to a public git repository

Your tasks must be hosted in a publicly accessible git repository. Each task should follow the [Harbor task format](/docs/tasks).

Organize your repository with one directory per task:

```
my-dataset/
├── task-1/
│   ├── instruction.md
│   ├── task.toml
│   ├── environment/
│   │   └── Dockerfile
│   ├── solution/
│   │   └── solve.sh
│   └── tests/
│       └── test.sh
├── task-2/
│   ├── instruction.md
│   ├── task.toml
│   ├── environment/
│   │   └── Dockerfile
│   └── tests/
│       └── test.sh
└── ...
```

Make sure to commit your changes and note the commit hash you want to use for your dataset version.

### 2. Create a registry entry

Add an entry to the [registry.json](https://github.com/laude-institute/harbor/blob/main/registry.json) file with the following structure:

```json
{
    "name": "your-dataset-name",
    "version": "1.0",
    "description": "A description of what your dataset evaluates",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "name": "task-1",
            "git_url": "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git",
            "git_commit_id": "abc123...",
            "path": "task-1"
        },
        {
            "name": "task-2",
            "git_url": "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git",
            "git_commit_id": "abc123...",
            "path": "task-2"
        }
    ]
}
```

### 3. Test your changes locally

Before submitting your PR, test that your registry entry works correctly by pointing to your local registry file:

```bash
harbor run -d "your-dataset-name@1.0" -a "<agent>" -m "<model>" --registry-path ./registry.json
```

This ensures your tasks are properly configured and accessible before you submit.

### 4. Submit a pull request

Open a pull request to the [Harbor repository](https://github.com/laude-institute/harbor) with your registry.json changes. Include in your PR description:

- What the dataset evaluates
- The number of tasks included
- Any relevant context about difficulty or domain

Once your PR is reviewed and merged, your dataset will be available to all Harbor users.
