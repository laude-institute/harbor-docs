Harbor is a framework for evals, post-training, and prompt optimization using agentic environments.

## Installation

```bash tab="uv"
uv tool install harbor
```

```bash tab="pip"
pip install harbor
```

## Running an eval

To evaluate an agent and model on a dataset, you can use the following command:

```bash
harbor run -d "<dataset@version>" -m "<model>" -a "<agent>"
```

Harbor will automatically download registered datasets. Local datasets can also be run using

```bash
harbor run -p "<path/to/dataset>" -m "<model>" -a "<agent>"
```

To run using a cloud sandbox provider like Daytona, you can use the following command:

```bash
harbor run -d "<dataset@version>" -m "<model>" -a "<agent>" --env "daytona" -n 32
```

If you run a cloud sandbox using an API model, trials become I/O bounded rather than compute bounded, which means you can typically parallelize far above your CPU count (the example command above runs 32 trials concurrently).

Sandboxes agent evaluations are often slow, because they can require many turns to complete and each command requires time to execute. Horizontal scaling becomes the only viable way to accelerate experimentation, so we recommend using a cloud sandbox provider like Daytona.
