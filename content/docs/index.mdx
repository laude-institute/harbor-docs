description: Why we built Harbor

Harbor is a framework for evaluating and optimizing (e.g. via RL) agents and models in container environments.

## Why container environments?

Right now, there are two agent paradigms emerging:

1. **Tool-use agents**, which constrain the action space to a set of very specific tools designed to complete very specific tasks.
1. **CLI agents**, which are general-purpose agents with an action space as large as the terminal that accomplish tasks by writing and executing code.

We believe that general-purpose agents will [become the dominant paradigm](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/1983209299624243529) and deserve their own framework for testing and development, which is why we built Harbor. CLI agents are already being used for [more than just coding tasks](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/1948765443776544885), and new sandboxed, general-purpose, CLI-equipped agents are emerging in other verticals (e.g. [Biomni](https://biomni.stanford.edu/)).
